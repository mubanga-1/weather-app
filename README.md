# ‚òÅ Weather App
Welcome to the **Weather App** project, developed as part of the Odin Project's curriculum projects. This project showcases use of external API's, DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript and efficient state management.

---

## üìñ Project Overview
The **Weather App** serves as a dyanmic single-page application (SPA) via which to search for the weather forcast for the current day following along the a seven day period. This project demonstrates the ability to:

---

- Use of third party APIs: The data used to showcase the weather forecast for an eight day period (current day inclusive) is retrieved from an external resource.

- Effectively parse data: The data is received in JSON format and made use of to display necessary information which the user is meant to take note of.

- Dynamically render content: All the HTML is dynamically rendered through the use of vanilla JavaScript, showing proficieny in DOM manipulation.

- Modular architecture: Each major piece of the project (getting data, generating the UI, displaying data) is encapsulated in its own JavaScript module, promoting clean and maintainable code.

- Utilize Webpack: This project is bundled using webpack, streamlining asset management and deployment.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Data Retrieval: JavaScript is used to request weather data is via an API call to an external service.
- Dynamic Content Rendering: A JavaScript module is used to generate the ui by injecting HTML content into the DOM.
- Webpack Integration: Effective bundling of assets for streamlined development and deployment.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+): For DOM manipuation and application logic.
- HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- Webpack: For bundling JavaScript modules and assets.
- npm: For managing project dependancies.
